## Features
Multiple modes to run the dataset
   - run - trains a model, generates and runs SDS
   - test - loads and tests all tests
   - tune - Uses RayTune, to optimize hyperparameters within a given search space, generates synth data and runs SDS
   - dataTest - loads data compare valid vs test for SDS

Wide range of options
    - Support for multiple workers thanks to RayTune
    - Many easy to access options including hyperparameters, choice of dataset, hardware assignment for each worker and more

## Requirements
   - Python 3.8.13 (other versions might work but have not been tested)
   - Preferabily one or more Nvidia GPUs


## Getting Started

### Setup
To get started we need to install some dependencies. This can be done with the following command.

Note: On other OS's than Linux, packages might be different (such as PyTorch), in which case consult the developers website for correct installation.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### First run
```
python Main.py
```

optionally you can use 

```
python Main.py --mode [mode]
```

where [mode] is one of the modes listed above


### Settings

You can change the default dataset (and much more!) by changing the string in default in Main.py to another dataset in the same folder 

```python
parser.add_argument("--dataset",			type=str,	default="nations",	help="Which dataset folder to use as input")
```

If you do not want the nations dataset or if you are offline, the download can be disabled with the following option:
```python
opt.dataset_download = False
```

You can also change the hyperparameter search space and more such as run modes parameters in Main.py
```python
#--- Search space settings
# Learning rate
tune_lr_min = 1e-4 #default: 1e-4
tune_lr_max = 1e-1 #default: 1e-1

tune_batch_sizes = [16, 32, 64, 128, 256] #default: [16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
tune_latent_dims = [32, 64, 128, 256, 512] #default: [32, 64, 128, 256, 512]

tune_n_critics = [1, 2, 3] #default: [1, 2, 3]

tune_f_loss_min_min = 1e-6 #default: 1e-6
tune_f_loss_min_max = 1e-1 #default: 1e-1
```

## The Team
We are a group of 7th semester Computer Science students from Aalborg University, who were tasked at creating "secure, scalable and usable systems".
