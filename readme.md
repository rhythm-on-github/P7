## Introduction

Loading of custom datasets
Includes multiple modes
   - generate - simply generates triples
   - run - trains a model, generates and runs SDS
   - test - loads and tests all tests
   - tune - Uses RayTune, to optimize hyperparameters within a given search space, generates synth data and runs SDS
   - datatest - loads data compare valid vs test for SDS
Wide range of options   

## Requirements
   - Python 3.8.13 (other versions might work but have not been tested)
   - preferabily one or more GPUs


## Getting Started

To get startet we need to install some dependencies, this can be done with this command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download dataset from ...

```
python Main.py
```

optionally you can use 

```
python Main.py --mode [mode]
```

where [mode] is one of the modes listed above

To change the default dataset change default to another dataset in same folder

```
parser.add_argument("--dataset",			type=str,	default="nations",	help="Which dataset folder to use as input")
```

to change hyperparemeters ...
