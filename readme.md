## Features

Multiple modes to run the dataset
   - generate - simply generates triples
   - run - trains a model, generates and runs SDS
   - test - loads and tests all tests
   - tune - Uses RayTune, to optimize hyperparameters within a given search space, generates synth data and runs SDS
   - datatest - loads data compare valid vs test for SDS

Wide range of options
    - Support for multiple workers thanks to RayTune
    - Many easy to access options including hyperparameters, choice of dataset, hardware assignment for each worker and more

## Requirements
   - Python 3.8.13 (other versions might work but have not been tested)
   - Preferabily one or more Nvidia GPUs


## Getting Started

### Setup
To get startet we need to install some dependencies, this can be done with this command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download dataset from ...


### First run
```
python Main.py
```

optionally you can use 

```
python Main.py --mode [mode]
```

where [mode] is one of the modes listed above


### Settings

You can change the default dataset(and much more!), by changing the string in default in Main.py to another dataset in same folder 

```python
parser.add_argument("--dataset",			type=str,	default="nations",	help="Which dataset folder to use as input")
```


You can also change the hyperparameters search space and and run modes parameters in Main.py
```python
#potentially run raytune, otherwise just train once
if opt.mode == "tune":
	config = {
		#"l1":			tune.sample_from(lambda _: 2 ** np.random.randint(2, 9)),
		#"l2":			tune.sample_from(lambda _: 2 ** np.random.randint(2, 9)),
		"lr":			tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1),
		"batch_size":	tune.choice([16, 32, 64, 128, 256]),
		"latent_dim":	tune.choice([32, 64, 128, 256, 512]),
		"n_critic":		tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),
		"f_loss_min":	tune.loguniform(1e-6, 1e-1),
	}
```

## The Team

We are a group of Computer Science students from 7th semester, who were tasked at creating "secure, scalable and usable systems".
